# Orange Star
*Where eating in is eating out.*

What if meal planning was as easy as ordering from a resturant menu? That's the goal of Orange Star. Choosing what to eat, making a grocery list while remembering what you already have in your pantry, and knowing what time to start dinner so it's ready at the same time are skills that can require a significant amount of planning ahead and motivation. Orange star aims to streamline and make that easier.

Once your typical recipes are in, choose what you want to eat like choosing from from a resturant menu:

1.  Make grocery lists easily by choosing what you want to eat from the menu.
2. Easily turn your grocery lists into an inventory of your pantry. 
3. Choose what you want to eat from a menu based on what's in your kitchen, and figure out what time you need to start cooking so that it will be ready at a reasonable hour. 
    
Orange Star keeps your organized. No standing in front of the fridge at 6pm, staring into your fridge and trying to figure out supper. Just order from the menu.

## How is Orange Star different from other nutrition and meal planning apps? Why choose Orange Star?

Orange Star focuses on streamlining meal planning. The goal is to get you from choosing your food, to the grocery store, cooking, and then to stay out of the way. Your interactions with the app should be brief "like choosing from a resturant menu". No complicated inventory. No complicated search. A few simple choices on a few simple screens.

### Recipes are Flexipes

On your recipes, you only mark ingredients you want to compare to inventory. Meaning you don't have to make sure you have common ingredients you always have, like black pepper, tracked in inventory, and it won't get constantly automatically added to your grocery list.

### Stupid Inventory (TM)

You don't need an accurate account of every last gram of flour in your cupboard, and you certainly don't want to enter the exact quantity of every morsel of food in your kitchen into a web app. You just need to know whether or not you have an ingredient to cook with. Orange Star keeps track of what you have in your kitchen with Stupid Inventory. You simply track whether or not an ingredient is present, which makes manually adding individual items to inventory a breeze.
