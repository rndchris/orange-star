### The Main Menu

Meal planning is just like ordering from a menu. Choose recipes from the menu and directly add the needed ingredients directly to your grocery list, then when it comes time to cook, figure out what you can cook from what you have on hand with the click of a button. You can even see what time you need to start cooking to have dinner on time.

Jigsaw is a handy feature that allows you to make use of ingredients that don't add up to a coherent recipe. Jigsaw finds ingredients in inventory that can't currently be used to cook a recipe from your menu and suggests recipes, which allows you to pick up the needed ingredients at the grocery store so you can finally cook through everything in your pantry.

The recipe manager tracks all of your recipes and allows you to add new recipes. The recipe manager also allows you to create new menu items too. Sick of an eating something? You can remove an item from the menu (done on the menu screen), and when you want to add it back to the menu, use the recipe manager to add it back to the menu, without ever deleting the recipe.

### How is Orange Star different from other nutrition and meal planning apps? Why choose Orange Star?

Orange Star focuses on streamlining meal planning. The goal is to get you from choosing your food, to the grocery store, cooking, and then to stay out of the way. Your interactions with the app should be brief, "like choosing from a resturant menu". No complicated inventory. No complicated search. A few simple choices on a few simple screens.

#### Recipes Ingredients are Flexible

On your recipes, you only mark ingredients you want to compare to inventory. You don't have to make sure you have common ingredients you always have, like black pepper, tracked in inventory, and it won't get constantly automatically added to your grocery list.

#### Stupid Inventory (TM)

You don't need an accurate account of every last gram of flour in your cupboard, and you certainly don't want to enter the exact quantity of every morsel of food in your kitchen into a web app. You just need to know whether or not you have an ingredient to cook with. Orange Star keeps track of what you have in your kitchen with Stupid Inventory. You simply track whether or not an ingredient is present, which makes manually adding individual items to inventory a breeze.
